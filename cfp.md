# Call for Papers

The Student Research Symposium is an LTI-wide event for students to show their recent and/or ongoing research and projects to the community. Submissions from students are selected to be presented as talks or posters/demos throughout the day-long event. During the event, talks and posters/demos are judged by a panel of students and faculty. This is a great chance to enjoy the camaraderie of students and faculty, and munch on good food together!

## Tracks

### Main Track 
We invite you to submit ongoing or near-completed work. Prior acceptance/presentation at other conferences is not necessary. This platform provides an excellent opportunity to present your mature ideas to a diverse audience, gain meaningful visibility, and gather fresh perspectives for your research.

Submission format: We accept full paper submissions in either an 8-page long paper format or a 4-page short paper format. The official ACL style is preferred. 

### Preliminary Work Track
We invite you to submit any novel or exploratory work still in its initial or formative stages. This track is particularly advantageous for garnering early feedback on your research concepts and project trajectories.

Submission format: We accept extended abstracts or short papers (1-2 pages long)

### Demo Track
You can submit tools/software that you build to this track. This could either be a demonstration of your research project, or a toolkit that you created that is useful/interesting. Examples include a GitHub repository, a website, or software that you can create a demo from (e.g, ExplainaBoard, rebiber).

Submission format: Describe the functions and usage of your tool in up to 4 pages. 

### Theme Track: Agents & Reasoning
We’re excited to announce this year’s special theme on agents and reasoning! Possible topics may include (but are not limited to):
- Generating (natural or synthetic) data for training LLM agents
- Embodied LLMs
- Societal considerations of LLM agents and safety
- Improving reasoning through training or inference-time compute
- Evaluation of various forms of reasoning
- …among many others!

### Note
**All paper submissions are recommended to follow official ACL style templates**, which are available here (https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files). However, for papers accepted or targeted at non-ACL conferences (e.g., ICML, NeurIPS), feel free to keep the original styles.

#### Presentation Format
Presentation formats include oral presentations (long and short) and posters. Full papers may have an either an oral and/or a poster, preliminary works can get an oral (short) and/or a poster. Allocations regarding presentation type will be made after submissions are received.

In the meantime, feel free to contact the SRS student committee members if you have any questions.
